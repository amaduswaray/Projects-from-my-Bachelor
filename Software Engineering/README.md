The goal of this course was to develop a fullyu fledged android app, using android studio and kotlin as a programming language.

## My Team
My team made an app that we kalled "kystvarsel". The purpose of this app was to alert people of the certain conditions that could be found at different coasts in norway. Our target group were boat drivers. The repository Kystvarsel contains the zip file of the entire project.
