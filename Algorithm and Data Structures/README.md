# IN2010 - Algorithms and Data Structures
The course provides a review of data structures such as stacks, trees, graphs, hash tables and priority queues, as well as algorithms for sorting, searching, insertion, and so on. Various implementations are assessed with emphasis on efficiency, program structure and abstract data types. Important elements of the subject are recursive programming as well as assessment and description of the programs effectiveness.


## Assigmnents
Some of our assigmnents were to implement some of the theory we have learned. I've chosen to include the assigmnent about graph traversal and sorting.

### Project Planner
This assigment is about creating a project planning tool. This is basically an implentation of topological sorting, where we have to sort our tasks(nodes) in the most critical order.


### Sorting algorithms
In this assigment we hasd to implement some sorting algorithms and run them on an input of different integers. With this we could compare accuracy and the efficiency on different sized inputs
