# IN2010: Algorithms and Data Structures
This is a theory heavy course where we lern about different algorithms and data structures, and how they function. The theories thaught in this course includes:
- Binary trees
- AVL trees
- Heaps
- Graphs and Graph theory
- Graph traversal
- Shortest path algorithms
- Sorting algorithms(bubble, insertion, selection, heap)
- Faster sorting algorithms(quick, bucket, radix)
- P and NP


## Assigmnents
Some of our assigmnents were to implement some of the theory we have learned. I've chosen to include the assigmnent about graph traversal and sorting.

### Project Planner
This assigment is about creating a project planning tool. This is basically an implentation of topological sorting, where we have to sort our tasks(nodes) in the most critical order.


### Sorting algorithms
In this assigment we hasd to implement some sorting algorithms and run them on an input of different integers. With this we could compare accuracy and the efficiency on different sized inputs
