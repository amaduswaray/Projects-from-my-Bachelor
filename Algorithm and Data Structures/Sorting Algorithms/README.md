# Sorting algorithms
In this task you have to implement 4 different sorting algorithms. The two mandetory algorithms are insertion sort and quick sort. The next algorithms has to be one which has a run time complexity of O(n^2) and O(nlog(n)).

### My Algorithms:
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Selection Sort
