# IN1010 Object Oriented Programming
This is a java course that is focused on object oriented programming. Classes, sub classes and interfaces are essential concepts in this course. In addition tp this, we learn about threads, java FX and linked lists.

## Assignments
The course consisted of multiple assigmnents, where some of them would build upon previous assigmnents. I've therefore chosen to include the final version of projects

### Computer Cluster
This assigment is about creating a system that has a view over every konponent in a computer cluster. A computer cluster contains multiple racks of nodes, that each has a memory. The files and pictures of the project are whithin the Computer Cluster directory


### System for doctors
This is a program which simulates how patients get resepts from doctors, and use them to get their medisin.

### Labyrinth
This is a program which finds the way out of a labyrinth, from a given spot. I've included 3 versions of this.
- The original solution
- One using threads
- One with java FX


### Dungeon game
