# IN1000: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
This course is an introduction to and gives a good base for further studies within computational science, but it´s also suited for those who just wish to understand what programming is. The course doesn´t presuppose any knowledge of programming. It´ll be given a beginners introduction to Python and how to develop algorithms, included the use of lists, files and communication with user. Particular emphasis is placed on object-oriented programming.

## Assignments
Most of the assignments in this course had a focus around the basic concepts of programming. Such as statements, variables, loops and data structures. I've chosen two of the more furfilling assignments for this repository.


### Game of Life
The assigmnent was to create a simulation of "Game of life". We had to create a player board and cells. The files and pictrures of the project are whithin the Game of Life directory.



### Computer Cluster
This assigment is about creating a system that has a view over every konponent in a computer cluster. A computer cluster contains multiple racks of nodes, that each has a memory. The files and pictures of the project are whithin the Computer Cluster directory
