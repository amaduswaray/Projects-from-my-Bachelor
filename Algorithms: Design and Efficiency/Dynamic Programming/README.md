# Sum of Problems
The problem “Sum of Selections” (SOS) is defined as follows: Given a sequence of n positive integers t1, t2, ... , tn and a positive integer K, we are asked to make a selection of the ti’s with sum exactly K (or determine that no such selection exists). Implement a Top Down and Bottom Up variant to solve this progblem.
