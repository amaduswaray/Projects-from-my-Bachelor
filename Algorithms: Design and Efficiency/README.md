# IN3130 - Algorithms: Design and Efficiency
The course provides a review of general algorithm classes such as dynamic programming, heuristic algorithms, probabilistic algorithms, and a representative selection of single algorithms that solve current issues. Emphasis is placed on efficiency assessment. Furthermore, it will review the theory of NP completeness and for irreversibility - problems without a solution algorithm.
